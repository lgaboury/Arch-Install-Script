# Arch-Insall-Script  
This script installs an Arch Linux base system alongside Windows.  
Assumes that partition nvme0n1p5 is used for the installation and will set existing nvme0n1p1 partition as ESP.  

## How to use  
1. Boot with Arch Linux ISO
2. Connect to the internet.  With my wireless card, I use:  
  a.  iwctl station wlan0 connect dlink
  b.  sdfsdf
  
4.
